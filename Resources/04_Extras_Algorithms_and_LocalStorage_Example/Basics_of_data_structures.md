# Basics of data structures and algorithms

For an extra [overview of this section about data structures and algorithms, check quarian's repository](https://github.com/quarian/mimmit-koodaa-trak-beginner). His repository includes also some valuable tests - for some of these exercises - to check that your logic is correct.

### What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

### What about algorithms?

An algorithm is a step by step method of solving a problem.
It is commonly used for data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations.
An algorithm is also used to manipulate data in various ways, such as inserting a new data item,
searching for a particular item or sorting an item.

## Chapter 1 - Simple Algorithm

For exercise 1, we want you to find the maximum value in an array of numbers

## Chapter 2 - Simple Algorithm II

For exercise 2, we want you to create an array of strings, say first names, and search for a specific name/string within the array and return its index position.

## Chapter 3 - Stack

In computer science, a [stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)>) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

Basically, for exercise 3, we would like you to either use JavaScript methods or a more verbose approach to add and remove items from an array/stack.

## Chapter 4 - Parenthesis balance

What's [parenthesis balance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-for-balanced-parentheses-in-an-expression/)? In our case, it's a function that allows us to check if for each opening parenthesis, whether it's `(` `[` or `{` there's a correspective closing one at the right place.

## Chapter 5 - Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. [Read more about bubble sort algorithm here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/).

## Chapter 6 - Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. [Read more about insertion sort algorithm here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/).

## Chapter 7 - Quick Sort

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. [Read more about quick sort algorithm here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/).
