# CSS Exercises

With the help of the [CSS learning resources of w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp), Google and your mentor, let's do the following assignments. Note: you don't have to complete all the assignments.

Assignment #0:
Just play around with the existing CSS styles; have fun and ask questions to your mentor!

The form looks pretty ugly and tiny, doesn't it? Shall we make it more pretty and accessible?

Assignment #1: Create a selector for the `<label>` element and add the following properties in its code block.

```css
font-weight: bold;
```

Assignment #2: Create a selector for the form `<input>` element and assign the following properties inside its code blocks.

```
min-width: 70%;
padding: 1rem;
font-size: 2rem;
border: 1px solid palevioletred;
```

Assignment #3: Make the submit `<button>` bigger and make the cursor look like a hand pointer when you hover on it; select the button in a way that if the form had more than one button, only the submit button would be affected.
